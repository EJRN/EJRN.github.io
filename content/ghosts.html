			<h1>Ghosts walking the castle's halls</h1>
			<p>Over the years many people have reported unearthly goings-on within the castle and it's grounds.  Family legend tells of a number of ghosts who reside within Callborough, most of whom met grisly ends.
			<h2>Tormod MacArronson</h2>
			<p>Tormod was the cheif of clan MacArronson until his brutal murder at the hands of his son Cormag in 1532.  
			It is spectulated that they were argueing over a marrage Tormod had arranged, but that argument was swiftley ended in Tormod's Tower, where Cormag stabbed Tormod in the back three times before slitting his throat.
			Over the generations many young MacArronson men have reported hearing Tormod's footsteps as he keeps an eye on them to ensure they don't get similar ideas.</p>
			<h2>The Silver Lady</h2>
			<p>Not much is known about the Silver Lady, but her presence has been reported on the upper floors.  
			She has never been directly seen, as she only ever appears in a mirror's reflection and will disappear as soon as you focus on her.  At the end of the 19th century the Prince of Wales visited the castle alongside his wife, Mary of Teck.
			After the evening's entertainment, Mary said that when she looked in the mirror she saw a woman dressed in a silvery tartan stood behind her, grasping something in her hand.  Mary was never clear if she saw the Lady holding a makeup brush, or a knife.</p>
			<h2>The Lonely Forrester</h2>
			<p>A number of people have said that when walking through the grounds at dusk they heard the sound of an axe swinging at a tree, but they were completely alone with no one around.
			Shortly after the Great War ended, Alice Callborough was taking an evening stroll through the grounds.  
			As a storm began to come in she headed back but on her way she heard the distinctive chopping noise always mentioned in stories of the Lonely Forrester.  Moments later, a tree came crashing down only feet away from her.</p>
