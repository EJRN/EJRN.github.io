			<h1>History of Callborough Keep</h1>
			<h2>Foundation</h2>
			<p>The foundations of the Great Hall have been traced back to the early 12th century, although little is known about the structure at that time.</p>
			<h2>Rebuilding</h2>
			<p>For unknown reasons, the castle was almost entirely rebuilt and expanded upon in the late 15th century by Calum MacArronson.  
			It was around this time that the castle wall was built, and also most of the Northern wing dates from this period.</p>
			<h2>1532 - Three stabs plus one for good luck</h2>
			<p>After a dispute over a marrage, Tormod MacArronson was murdered by his son in the southern tower, now known as Tormod's Tower.  
			It is said that he is the oldest of the castle's ghosts, and still walks the grounds.  
			It is beleived he follows young men around the castle to ensure none ever murder their fathers again.</p>
