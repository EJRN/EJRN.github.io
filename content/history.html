			<h1>History of Callborough Keep</h1>
			
			<h2>Foundation</h2>
			<p>The foundations of the Great Hall have been traced back to the early 12th century, although little is known about the structure at that time.</p>
			
			<h2>Rebuilding</h2>
			<p>For unknown reasons, the castle was almost entirely rebuilt and expanded upon in the late 15th century by Calum MacArronson.  
			It was around this time that the castle wall was built, and also most of the Northern wing dates from this period.</p>
			
			<h2>1532 - Three stabs plus one for good luck</h2>
			<p>After a dispute over a marrage, Tormod MacArronson was stabbed three times in the back before having his throat slit by his son in the southern tower, now known as Tormod's Tower.  
			It is said that he is the oldest of the castle's ghosts, and still walks the grounds.  
			Every MacArronson boy is told that he follows young men around the castle to ensure none ever murder their fathers again.</p>
			
			<h2>Late 1600s - The last wolf hunt</h2>
			<p>On an unrecorded date, Duncan MacArronson lead the last of the regular wolf hunts from Callborough.  
			His sword, which now hangs in the great hall, is said to be imbue the wielder with the bravery of the dozens of wolves slain by it's blade.</p>
			
			<h2>1897 - Royal Visit</h2>
			<p>The Prince of Wales and his new wife stayed at the Castle as part of a tour of the highlands.  They enjoyed a traditional feast, followed by a ceilidh.</p>
			
			<h2>1985 - Donald and Eilidh MacArronson take the Reigns</h2>
			<p>Donald MacArronson returned to his childhoodhome to manage the castle, wih his wife and young son.  Later, he opens the castle to be rented for events.</p>
